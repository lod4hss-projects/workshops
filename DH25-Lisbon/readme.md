# DH2025 Conference in Lisbon - 15.07.2025

LOD4HSS, a Collaborative Linked Open Data Research Environment and Methodologies for the Humanities and Social Sciences

Building upon the experience of the previous DH 2024 Conference in Washington, where the focus was on introduction to data modelling and data entry (including basic integration and enrichment), this new mini-conference will take a step further in leveraging already existing technologies on the web and mobilise them for integration, through the use of a common methodology.

This mini-conference will first allow an introduction to the LOD4HSS (previously Geovistory) environment for the participants and a deeper presentation of the vision that supports it. It will then focus on one of its key elements, which is data interoperability and reusability. Throughout the workshop, external resources will be examined, and information will be extracted and structured using innovative semantic tools (notably the Local Graph Editor (LOGRE ) based on SHACL profiles) relying on the common SDHSS ontology. Data will then be explored with the participants, allowing new analysis in connection with the integrated data.

This mini-conference will present a methodology for reuse through semantification of information available online in the form of Linked Open Data, adopting appropriate tools for data extraction and structuration within the LOD4HSS environment.
