This graph comprises data imported from Wikidata about a population of astronomers and physicists.

The SPARQL notebooks documenting the data import and wrangling are available in the [*Astronomers* project](https://github.com/Sciences-historiques-numeriques/astronomers/tree/main/sparqlbooks), which I use in my master's courses at the University of Neuch√¢tel.
